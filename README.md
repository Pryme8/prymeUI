prymeUI : http://pryme8.github.io/prymeUI/
=======

jQuery plugin that allows for automatic styling of DOM elements.


In some cases the element is replaced with a prymeElement... though the original still exsists the new element controls the hidden original.  In theory none of your forms should break from usage of this.

Current support:

<b>input</b> - CSS
(I will be looking to add regEx expressions that you can tie to input boxes and have prymeUI check them or strip the input to provided regex strings)

<b>select</b> - CSS/JS
(almost done implementing this feature, last step is multiselect box which will not be that hard I jsut have not had time.

<b>toolTips</b> - CSS/HTML data-tag
(add provided classes for direction of tool tip, and then add the html string in the element to have prymeUI's CSS detect it and create dynamic tooltips.)
